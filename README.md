A Flutter Apprentice tutorial by Ray Wenderlich. 

## Description
This is Section IV: Chapter 9 of the Flutter Apprentice Tutorial titled:

### 9. Shared Preference

Use the shared_preference plugin to save important pieces of information to the device.

  - Save searches for recipes as a bookmark in a local database
  - Save the page the user was on when the app was closed and go to that page when the app is re-run

Again, this one was a mostly copy/paste exercise for me. I do/did? read through the code but I didn't type it in as I did for the previous tutorials.
